## Scope
[Equity Summit](https://equitysummit.skyrocket-ed.com/) is an annual online conference that brings together educators, administrators, and advocates dedicated to advancing equity in education. Each year, the summit adopts a unifying theme that guides speaker presentations and conference programming. For 2025, the theme "Generations Connected" explores the intersections of intergenerational dialogue and educational equity.

### Role & Approach
At [Skyrocket Education](https://www.skyrocket-ed.com/), I led the design and development of the [Equity Summit website](https://equitysummit.skyrocket-ed.com/) in collaboration with the marketing and design teams. I developed a comprehensive visual identity and digital platform for this year's summit, centering the approach on creating a cohesive brand experience that reflected the theme while delivering essential functionality.

The website was designed to serve two primary objectives: providing visitors with detailed speaker profiles and backgrounds, and amplifying the powerful messages and insights each presenter brings to the conversation. Through thoughtful design and strategic content organization, I created an accessible gateway to transformative educational discourse while honoring the diverse voices and perspectives that make Equity Summit a vital annual gathering.
