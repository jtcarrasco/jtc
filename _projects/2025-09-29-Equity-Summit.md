## Scope
Equity Summit is an annual online conference that brings together educators, administrators, and advocates dedicated to advancing equity in education. Each year, the summit adopts a unifying theme that guides speaker presentations and conference programming. For 2025, the theme "Generations Connected" explores the intersections of intergenerational dialogue and educational equity.

### Design and Development
In collaboration with the Skyrocket marketing and design teams, we developed a comprehensive visual identity and digital platform for this year's summit. Our approach centered on creating a cohesive brand experience that reflected the theme while delivering essential functionality.

The website was designed to serve two primary objectives: providing visitors with detailed speaker profiles and backgrounds, and amplifying the powerful messages and insights each presenter brings to the conversation. The result is an engaging, user-friendly platform that connects attendees with thought leaders and facilitates meaningful exploration of equity-focused topics.

Through thoughtful design and strategic content organization, the site creates an accessible gateway to transformative educational discourse while honoring the diverse voices and perspectives that make Equity Summit a vital annual gathering.
