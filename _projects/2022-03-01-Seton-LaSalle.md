## Scope
Seton LaSalle Catholic High School is a private co-educational institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, formed through the merger of two historic Catholic schools. The school serves students in grades 9-12 with a focus on faith-based education, academic excellence, and athletic achievement.

### Role & Approach
I led the web development and project coordination for Seton LaSalle's website at Edlio, working closely with the school's administration to create a digital presence that reflected their identity as a faith-centered academic community.

The project required careful attention to showcasing the school's admissions process, athletic programs, and campus life while providing prospective families with a clear path to enrollment. Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site featured integrated CMS tools and responsive design to ensure accessibility across all devices.

As technical liaison, I managed communication between the client and internal teams throughout the project, coordinating content gathering, design reviews, and production milestones to deliver the site on schedule.
