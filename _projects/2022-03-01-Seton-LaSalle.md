## Scope
[Seton LaSalle Catholic High School](https://www.slshs.org/) is a private co-educational institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, formed through the merger of two historic Catholic schools. The school serves students in grades 9-12 with a focus on faith-based education, academic excellence, and athletic achievement.

### Role & Approach
At [Edlio](https://www.edlio.com/), I collaborated with a project manager and designer to deliver [Seton LaSalle's website](https://www.slshs.org/), serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. The project required careful attention to showcasing the school's admissions process, athletic programs, and campus life while providing prospective families with a clear path to enrollment — all while reflecting their identity as a faith-centered academic community.

Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site featured integrated CMS tools and responsive design to ensure accessibility across all devices. Working alongside the project manager, I helped manage communication between the school's administration and our internal teams, while collaborating closely with the designer through content gathering, design reviews, and production milestones to deliver the site on schedule.
