## Scope
[DAS Beer Garden](https://www.dasbeergarden.com/) is a craft beer taproom and restaurant in Jupiter, Florida, located in Downtown Abacoa. The venue features Cicerone-certified beer servers, a rotating craft beer lineup, a full food menu, live music, and weekly events like trivia and karaoke. With a dog-friendly patio and 25+ screens for sports, DAS has established itself as a neighborhood gathering spot for the Jupiter community.

### Role & Approach
I designed and developed the [DAS Beer Garden website](https://www.dasbeergarden.com/) as a freelance project. The site needed to capture the venue's laid-back, community-focused personality while serving practical goals — driving foot traffic, promoting events, and making it easy for visitors to find hours, location, and menu information.

The design reflected the brand's craft beer identity with a bold, inviting aesthetic. I focused on making the event calendar and rotating beer lineup easy to update, giving the DAS team the ability to keep their site current without technical overhead. The responsive design ensured a seamless experience for mobile users checking hours or directions on the go.
