This large-scale initiative involved the strategic design and development of 12 websites serving the various regional divisions of the Options for Youth (OFY) and Opportunities for Learning (OFL) charter school networks.

Each site was tailored to its respective region, including the Sharks division, which serves students throughout the Santa Clarita Valley in greater Los Angeles County. Other regional sites developed for this project include:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
- 8
- 9
- 10
- 11
- 12
  
This project involved direct collaboration with principals and administrators to gather and organize site-specific content. In partnership with the Skyrocket Marketing team and Propel enrollment department, we developed a user experience that provided prospective students with pertinent regional information and clear pathways to enrollment.
