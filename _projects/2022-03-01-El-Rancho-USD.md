## Scope
El Rancho Unified School District serves the Pico Rivera community in southeast Los Angeles County, providing education to approximately 8,500 students across 15 schools. The district prides itself on preparing students for college and career readiness through innovative programs and strong community partnerships.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I collaborated with a project manager and designer to deliver El Rancho USD's website redesign, serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. As the primary technical contact for the district, I worked alongside the project manager to coordinate with their administrative team, ensuring the final product reflected the district's values and met their operational needs.

Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site leveraged integrated CMS tools, mobile app connectivity, and accessibility features to create a user-friendly experience for students, parents, and staff. Working closely with the designer, I translated visual concepts into a functional, accessible build while helping keep the production workflow on track and ensuring the project met both district requirements and web accessibility standards.

The result was a clean, responsive website that made it easier for the El Rancho community to stay connected with their schools.
