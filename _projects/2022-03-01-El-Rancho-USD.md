## Scope
El Rancho Unified School District serves the Pico Rivera community in southeast Los Angeles County, providing education to approximately 8,500 students across 15 schools. The district prides itself on preparing students for college and career readiness through innovative programs and strong community partnerships.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I managed the complete web development lifecycle for El Rancho USD's website redesign. As the technical point of contact for the district, I coordinated between their administrative team and our internal designers and developers to deliver a site that reflected the district's values and met their operational needs.

Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site leveraged integrated CMS tools, mobile app connectivity, and accessibility features to create a user-friendly experience for students, parents, and staff. I ensured the production workflow stayed on track and that the final product met both district requirements and web accessibility standards.

The result was a clean, responsive website that made it easier for the El Rancho community to stay connected with their schools.
