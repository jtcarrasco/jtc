## Scope
Options For Youth (OFY) is a network of tuition-free public charter schools serving students across California. OFY provides personalized education through flexible scheduling and individualized learning plans, reaching students who benefit from an alternative to traditional classroom settings.

### Role & Approach
While at Skyrocket Education, I managed the web development and production coordination for the Options For Youth website — a large-scale project requiring alignment across multiple stakeholders, from school administrators to marketing teams, to create a unified digital presence for the OFY network.

The site was built on WordPress, with a customized CMS experience, mobile-friendly layouts, and accessibility tooling baked in throughout. I served as the primary technical liaison, coordinating production workflows and maintaining consistent quality across the site. The design prioritized making enrollment information easy to find while presenting OFY's personalized education model in a compelling, approachable way.

This project deepened my familiarity with the OFY network and laid the groundwork for my continued work at Skyrocket Education, where I later led the development of regional campus websites that expanded and modernized the network's digital presence.
