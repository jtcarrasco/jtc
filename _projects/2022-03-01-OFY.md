## Scope
Options For Youth (OFY) is a network of tuition-free public charter schools serving students across California. OFY provides personalized education through flexible scheduling and individualized learning plans, reaching students who benefit from an alternative to traditional classroom settings.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I managed the web development and production coordination for the Options For Youth website. This was a large-scale project involving coordination across multiple stakeholders, from school administrators to marketing teams, to create a unified digital presence for the OFY network.

The site was built on Edlio's K-12 platform, integrating CMS, mobile app connectivity, and accessibility tools. I served as the primary technical liaison, managing production workflows and ensuring consistent quality across the site. The design focused on making enrollment information easily accessible and presenting OFY's personalized education model in a compelling way.

This project laid the groundwork for my continued work with OFY at Skyrocket Education, where I later led the development of [regional campus websites](/project/Regional-Websites-OFY-OFL) that expanded and modernized the network's digital presence.
