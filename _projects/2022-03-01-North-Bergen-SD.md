## Scope
North Bergen School District serves the community of North Bergen, New Jersey, providing education to over 7,000 students across multiple schools. The district is one of the largest in Hudson County and is recognized for its diverse student population and commitment to bilingual education programs.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I collaborated with a project manager and designer to deliver North Bergen School District's website redesign, serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. The project involved creating a comprehensive digital platform that served a diverse, multilingual community while meeting New Jersey's school district web requirements.

A key challenge was designing an intuitive navigation structure that made it easy for families to find school-specific information across the district's many campuses. Built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, the site leveraged CMS tools, mobile app integration, and built-in accessibility features to create an inclusive digital experience.

Working alongside the project manager, I served as the technical liaison between the district's administration and our internal teams. I collaborated closely with the designer through content development and design iterations, helping keep production timelines on track to deliver a site that met both the district's operational needs and community expectations.
