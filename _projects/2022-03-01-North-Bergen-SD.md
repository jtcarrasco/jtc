## Scope
North Bergen School District serves the community of North Bergen, New Jersey, providing education to over 7,000 students across multiple schools. The district is one of the largest in Hudson County and is recognized for its diverse student population and commitment to bilingual education programs.

### Role & Approach
I led the web development and project coordination for North Bergen School District's website at Edlio. The project involved creating a comprehensive digital platform that served a diverse, multilingual community while meeting New Jersey's school district web requirements.

A key challenge was designing an intuitive navigation structure that made it easy for families to find school-specific information across the district's many campuses. Built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, the site leveraged CMS tools, mobile app integration, and built-in accessibility features to create an inclusive digital experience.

As technical liaison, I coordinated between the district's administration and our internal teams, managing content development, design iterations, and production timelines to deliver a site that met both the district's operational needs and community expectations.
