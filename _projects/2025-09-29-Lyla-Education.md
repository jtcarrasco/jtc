## Scope
Lyla Education (Launch Your Learning Applications) is an EdTech platform that develops educational technology applications designed to accommodate diverse learning styles. The platform offers both paper-based and digital learning options, allowing students to engage with content in ways that suit their individual needs — whether visual, auditory, or tactile. Lyla integrates with existing Student Activity Workbooks (SAWs) and Studenttrac systems, providing flexible access to courses ranging from social media literacy to music exploration.

### Role & Approach
At Skyrocket Education, I led the design and development of the Lyla Education website. The site serves as the public-facing platform for an EdTech product still in active development, so the design needed to balance showcasing the platform's capabilities with guiding prospective clients toward beta testing and demonstrations.

I created a clean, modern interface that communicates Lyla's core value — flexible, accessible learning that meets students where they are. The site highlights key features like offline learning capabilities, SSO integration, plagiarism remediation tools, and multi-format content delivery. The design emphasizes the platform's adaptability for diverse learners while maintaining a professional presentation geared toward school administrators and decision-makers evaluating the product.
