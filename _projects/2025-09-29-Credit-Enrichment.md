## Scope
Credit Enrichment is a free public charter high school program operated by Options for Youth (OFY) and Opportunities for Learning (OFL). The program offers a flexible, personalized approach to education, enabling students in grades 9-12 to recover or accelerate high school credits through guided independent study. Students can earn up to 10 credits in as little as six weeks, with both in-person and 100% online options available across Northern and Southern California.

### Role & Approach
At Skyrocket Education, I led the design and development of the Credit Enrichment website. The site needed to clearly communicate the program's value proposition — free, flexible credit recovery — to prospective students and their families while driving enrollment across multiple regional locations.

I focused on creating a clean, student-friendly experience that made it easy to understand the two program formats (in-person and online), explore A-G and NCAA approved coursework, and take the next step toward enrollment. The design emphasized accessibility and simplicity, recognizing that the target audience includes students who may already feel overwhelmed by their academic situation.

The result is a straightforward, action-oriented site that connects students with the resources they need to get back on track toward graduation.
