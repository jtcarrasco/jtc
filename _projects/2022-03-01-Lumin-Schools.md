## Scope
Lumin Schools is a nonprofit school network based in Dallas, Texas, dedicated to providing high-quality education to underserved communities. The organization operates multiple campuses with a mission rooted in social impact, offering students a supportive learning environment focused on academic achievement and character development.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I collaborated with a project manager and designer to build Lumin Schools' digital platform, serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. The website needed to serve as both an enrollment tool for prospective families and a storytelling platform that highlighted Lumin's commitment to educational equity.

Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site featured integrated CMS tools, responsive design, and accessibility compliance. I worked alongside the project manager as the technical liaison between Lumin's leadership team and our internal design staff, while translating the designer's vision into a polished, functional build throughout the project lifecycle.

The final product balanced the organization's need for a professional digital presence with the warmth and community focus that defines their mission.
