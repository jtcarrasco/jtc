## Scope
Lumin Schools is a nonprofit school network based in Dallas, Texas, dedicated to providing high-quality education to underserved communities. The organization operates multiple campuses with a mission rooted in social impact, offering students a supportive learning environment focused on academic achievement and character development.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I led the web development and project coordination for Lumin Schools, building a digital platform that communicated the organization's nonprofit mission and community impact. The website needed to serve as both an enrollment tool for prospective families and a storytelling platform that highlighted Lumin's commitment to educational equity.

Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site featured integrated CMS tools, responsive design, and accessibility compliance. I managed the full project lifecycle, serving as the technical liaison between Lumin's leadership team and our internal designers and developers.

The final product balanced the organization's need for a professional digital presence with the warmth and community focus that defines their mission.
