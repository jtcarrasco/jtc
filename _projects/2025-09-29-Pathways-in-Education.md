## Scope
Pathways in Education required a comprehensive digital transformation for their schools spanning the country from Idaho to Louisiana. The challenge was to balance multiple critical objectives: creating user-friendly websites that maintained compliance with district and state documentation requirements while establishing a cohesive brand identity across all regions.

### Strategic Approach
Our design strategy focused on achieving three key goals:

- **Enhanced User Experience** — We prioritized intuitive navigation and accessibility, ensuring that students, families, and stakeholders could easily find essential information while the sites continued to meet rigorous accountability standards.
- **Regional Customization with Brand Unity** — Each regional site was tailored to reflect its local community and specific needs, while maintaining consistent brand elements that reinforced Pathways in Education's national identity and values.
- **Streamlined Enrollment Process** — We redesigned the enrollment experience to remove friction points and simplify the application journey, making it easier for prospective students to take action and complete their registration.
The result was a scalable digital ecosystem that serves diverse communities across the country while maintaining a unified brand presence and driving meaningful enrollment engagement.
