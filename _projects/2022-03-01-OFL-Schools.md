## Scope
Opportunities For Learning (OFL) is a network of tuition-free public charter schools in California, serving students who thrive with individualized instruction and flexible scheduling. As a sister organization to Options For Youth, OFL shares a commitment to providing accessible, personalized education to students across multiple regions.

### Role & Approach
While at Skyrocket Education, I served as the web development and production coordinator for the Opportunities For Learning website, a K-12 district site I maintained and evolved rather than built from scratch. Working closely with OFL's administrative team, I helped shape a digital platform that clearly communicated the network's mission and streamlined the enrollment experience for prospective students and families.

The site was built on WordPress and featured responsive design, ADA compliance, mobile-friendly layouts, and a customized CMS experience that empowered staff to manage content independently without developer intervention. My role spanned the full production lifecycle, coordinating workflows across internal teams and keeping the project moving from planning through deployment.

This work with OFL laid the groundwork for a broader engagement, leading me to develop regional campus websites for both OFL and OFY, expanding on the foundation established during this initial project.
