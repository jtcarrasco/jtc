## Scope
Opportunities For Learning (OFL) is a network of tuition-free public charter schools in California, serving students who thrive with individualized instruction and flexible scheduling. As a sister organization to Options For Youth, OFL shares a commitment to providing accessible, personalized education to students across multiple regions.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I led the web development and production coordination for the Opportunities For Learning website. The project required close collaboration with OFL's administrative team to create a digital platform that effectively communicated the network's mission and simplified the enrollment process for prospective students and families.

Built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, the site featured responsive design, CMS tools for easy content updates, mobile app integration, and ADA compliance. I coordinated production workflows across internal teams, managing the project from concept through deployment.

My work with OFL continued at Skyrocket Education, where I developed [regional campus websites](/project/Regional-Websites-OFY-OFL) for both OFL and OFY, building on the foundation established during the Edlio era.
