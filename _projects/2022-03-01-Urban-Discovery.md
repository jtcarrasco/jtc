## Scope
Urban Discovery Schools is a charter school organization in San Diego, California, operating in partnership with UC San Diego. The school emphasizes project-based learning and STEAM education, offering a unique academic model that connects students with university resources and real-world research opportunities.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I led the web development and project coordination for Urban Discovery Schools, creating a digital platform that communicated the school's distinctive partnership with UC San Diego and its innovative approach to education.

The website needed to serve multiple audiences — prospective families exploring enrollment, current parents staying informed, and community partners understanding the school's mission. Built on Edlio's K-12 platform, the site integrated CMS tools, mobile accessibility, and ADA-compliant design to ensure a seamless experience for all users.

I served as the technical liaison between the school and our internal teams, managing the project timeline and coordinating content development to highlight their STEAM curriculum and university partnership.
