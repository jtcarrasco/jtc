## Scope
Rowland Unified School District serves over 13,000 students across 18 schools in the San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles County. The district is known for its commitment to dual language programs, college readiness initiatives, and inclusive learning environments.

### Role & Approach
As part of the Edlio team, I led the web development and project coordination for Rowland USD's digital presence. This involved serving as the primary technical liaison between the district and our internal design and development teams, managing the project from initial concept through final deployment.

The project was built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, which provided a comprehensive suite of tools including CMS, mobile apps, mass communications, online payments, and built-in accessibility features. I coordinated production workflows to ensure the site met ADA compliance standards while highlighting the district's dual language programs and diverse academic offerings.

The responsive design ensured a consistent experience across devices, making it easy for families to access important information whether on desktop or mobile.
