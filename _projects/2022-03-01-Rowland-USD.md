## Scope
Rowland Unified School District serves over 13,000 students across 18 schools in the San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles County. The district is known for its commitment to dual language programs, college readiness initiatives, and inclusive learning environments.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I collaborated with a project manager and designer to deliver Rowland USD's digital presence, serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. As a proud alumnus of Rowland USD, this project held personal significance — it was a privilege to give back to the district that shaped my own education. Working alongside the project manager, I helped guide the project from initial concept through final deployment, serving as the primary technical liaison between the district and our internal teams.

Built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, the site leveraged a comprehensive suite of tools including CMS, mobile apps, mass communications, online payments, and built-in accessibility features. I coordinated with the project manager on production workflows to ensure ADA compliance while working closely with the designer to highlight the district's dual language programs and diverse academic offerings.

The responsive design ensured a consistent experience across devices, making it easy for families to access important information whether on desktop or mobile.
