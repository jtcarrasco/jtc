## Scope
St. Charles Borromeo Parish School is a Catholic elementary school serving families in the greater Los Angeles area. The school provides a faith-centered education for students in grades TK-8, blending rigorous academics with spiritual development and community engagement.

### Role & Approach
At Edlio, I collaborated with a project manager and designer to deliver St. Charles Borromeo's website, serving as the lead developer responsible for the site's technical implementation. The project focused on creating an inviting digital presence that reflected the school's welcoming parish community while providing practical tools for current and prospective families.

Key priorities included streamlining the admissions information flow, showcasing the school's academic and faith-based programs, and making it easy for parents to access essential resources. Built on Edlio's integrated K-12 platform, the site featured responsive design, CMS tools for easy content management, and built-in accessibility compliance.

Working alongside the project manager, I helped coordinate all phases of production from initial planning and content gathering through design reviews and final deployment, while collaborating closely with the designer to ensure the finished site captured the warmth and character of the school community.
