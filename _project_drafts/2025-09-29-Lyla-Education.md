## Scope
Options for Youth (OFY) and Opportunities for Learning (OFL) required a strategic shift in their digital presence. Unlike traditional charter school websites that prioritize board agendas and state compliance documentation, both organizations needed student-focused platforms designed to showcase their programs and drive enrollment.

In collaboration with the brand content marketing specialist, we developed a comprehensive site template and unified messaging framework. This scalable solution was designed to maintain brand consistency while accommodating the unique needs of various regional campuses across both the OFY and OFL networks.

The result was a cohesive digital experience that puts students first, making it easier for prospective families to understand program offerings and take the next steps toward enrollment.

### Collaborative Approach and User Experience

The project required close collaboration with school principals and administrators to gather and curate site-specific content tailored to each regional campus. Working alongside the Skyrocket Marketing team and Propel enrollment department, we designed a user experience that seamlessly connected prospective students with relevant regional information while establishing clear, intuitive pathways to enrollment.
This cross-functional partnership ensured that the platform served both marketing objectives and enrollment goals, creating a streamlined journey from initial interest to program registration.
