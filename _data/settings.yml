He listened to our goals and implemented every one of them on the first attempt, noticed potential roadblocks, and made suggestions around additional elements, plugins and SEO that have already proven their worth. His work was super fast and on-brand, which was exactly what we needed. I highly recommend Jason if you are looking for a web developer who can exceed your expectations."
