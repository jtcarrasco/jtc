## Why, Hello There

Thank you for visiting my website. I'm a Los Angeles-based web developer, designer, and project manager with more than 15 years of experience creating custom digital solutions. Throughout my career, I've partnered with clients ranging from small businesses to large organizations, delivering web projects that combine functionality with user-focused design.

Outside of work, I live in Redondo Beach, California, with my wife Margot, daughter Petra, and our furbabies Lola😺 and Angel🐶.

## What I've Done

Over the course of my career, I've had the opportunity to work on more than 350 website projects across a variety of industries, with a strong background in the education sector. From coordinating large-scale production workflows to leading web development and design initiatives, my roles have consistently spanned development, project management, and creative direction.

I understand the unique challenges organizations face in the digital space, whether they're managing complex content ecosystems, streamlining user journeys, or building tools that serve both staff and end users. My experience includes developing robust solutions for sales, admissions, and enrollment workflows, designing intuitive user interfaces, and creating digital experiences that simplify complex processes. Whatever the context, my focus is always on building solutions that are functional, scalable, and easy to use.

## What I Write About

I also run [cosmikdebris.site](https://cosmikdebris.site), a personal blog where I write about maker projects, Linux installs, hardware hacks, and experimental tech. It's where I explore the things that keep me curious outside of work. Tinkering with gear, breaking things on purpose, and figuring out how to put them back together.

## Things I Love

In my free time I'm an [avid music collector](https://www.discogs.com/user/jtcarrasco), dog walker, and cat wrangler. I enjoy science fiction books, traveling, cooking, and family bike rides.

Feel free to [drop me a line](/contact)

## Things I Hate
