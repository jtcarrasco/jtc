## Why, Hello there

Thank you for visiting my cool website, I'm a Los Angeles-based web developer and designer with more than 15 years of experience creating custom digital solutions. Throughout my career, I've partnered with clients ranging from small businesses to large school districts, delivering web projects that combine functionality with user-focused design.

Outside of work, I live in Redondo Beach, California, with my wife Margot, daughter Petra, and our furbabies Lola😺 and Angel🐶.

## What I've done

Over the course of my career, I've had the opportunity to work on more than 350 website projects, with educational institutions serving as my primary area of expertise. I understand the unique challenges schools and districts face in the digital space, and I've developed targeted solutions to address them.

My experience includes building robust tools for sales and admissions departments, designing user-friendly enrollment portals, and creating digital experiences that simplify complex processes. Whether it's helping prospective students navigate the enrollment journey or empowering staff with efficient administrative tools, my focus is always on creating solutions that are both functional and intuitive.

## Things I love

In my free time I’m an [avid music collector](https://www.discogs.com/user/jtcarrasco), dog walker and cat wrangler. I enjoy science fiction books, traveling, cooking and family bike rides.
